Personalities: Shen Xue/Zhao Hongbo began their pairs skating in August 1992. Shen and Zhao won the Olympic gold medal in 2010, truncating almost half a century of Russian dominance in the Olympic figure skating pairs event. The pair's technique is characterised by difficult movements, but their artistic expression is slightly lacking, which has seen them miss out on a number of titles at world competitions. To make up for this, Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo have travelled to Europe and the United States to train and have been guided by foreign experts in their artistic expression. In addition, their “throw quad jump" is one of the most difficult in the world.

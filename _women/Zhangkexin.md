Personalities: She is a great physical performer, but is often criticised for her lack of expression; Zhang Kexin is a power player, but unfortunately she is introverted and lacks passion. However, she has improved in recent years in terms of performance. Very good at hook triple (3Lutz), backward outer point triple followed by backward outer point triple (3T+3T), but backward inner point triple (Filip triple, 3Filp) has an outside edge error, reserve difficulty is hook triple followed by backward outer point triple (3Lz+3T).
